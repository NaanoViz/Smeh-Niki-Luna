<section id="About">
    <h2>About</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Smeh Niki, a recent graduate with a bachelors in Biomedical Engineering. Throughout my time in college,
        I have learned many disciplnes in Biomedical Engineering, and throughout that time, I always believed programming to be 
        a vital, pivotal point in any field of research regarding this subject. Even after graduation I strongly believe the 
        significance programming holds in many advances regarding this field. 
     </p>
     <p>
        I currently aim to create/assist in the development of a self-analyzing, monitoring, and self-adminstering nano-robot
        that can assist the human body invivo. I am still in the process of building skills that can greatly assist me in this goal.
